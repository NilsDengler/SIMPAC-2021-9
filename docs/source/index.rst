************************************
Welcome to RL Reach's documentation!
************************************

`RL Reach <https://github.com/PierreExeter/rl_reach>`_ is a toolbox for 
running reproducible reinforcement learning experiments applied 
to solving the reaching task with a robot manipulator.
The training Gym environments are adapted from 
the `Replab <https://github.com/bhyang/replab>`_ project.
The training scripts and RL algorithms are based on 
the `Stable Baselines 3 <https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3>`_ implementation 
and its `Zoo <https://github.com/DLR-RM/rl-baselines3-zoo>`_ of trained agents.
